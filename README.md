# Ray Tracing in a ~Weekend~ Month

This project was done following the book "[_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)" as well as its sequel "[_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)"

Various scenes have been rendered and saved in [images](./images), but the final renders for both books are as follows:
